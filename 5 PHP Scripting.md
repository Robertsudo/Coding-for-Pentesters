PHP is a scripting language (web-scripting)

PHP variables are prefixed by dollar sign $ ========> like Perl
Every statement ends with semicolon ; () =========> like Perl
```php
<?php
	$integer = 5;
	$boolean = true;
	$array = array(1,2,3,4,5);
	function something() {
		codehere
	}
?>
```
these are all arrays:
`$_GET` => captures HTTP GET requests in a form
`$_POST` => captures HTTP POST requests in a form
`$_REQUEST` => captures both
`$_FILE` => captures file uploads

```php
<?php
	http://localhost/readwrite.php?read=/etc/passwd&write=/tmp/writehere&data=randomdata
# how does PHP parse this data?
if($_GET['read']) {
	$file_name_to_read = $_GET['read'];
	# dummy function ===> read($file_name_to_read)
}
if($_GET['write'] && $_GET['data']) {
	# if "write" and "data" parameters are SET
	$file = $_GET['write'];
	$data = $_GET['data'];
	$file_handler = fopen($file,"a+"); # OPEN THE FILE IN APPEND MODE
	fwrite($file_handler,$data . "\n");
	fclose($file_handler);
}
?>
```
`?read=/etc/passwd` ============>  `file_name_to_read = /etc/passwd` via HTTP GET REQUEST

# Command Execution in PHP
3 functions:
1. Passthru
2. Exec
3. System

```php
<?php
$file = $_GET['file'];
passthru("ls -la $file");
?>
```
vulnerable!
normal usage: `http://localhost?file=myfile.txt`
abnormal usage: `http://localhost?file=anything;cat /etc/passwd`
notice semicolon ; to split commands in BASH
```php
<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
```
bad code: `http://localhost?cmd=cat /etc/passwd; rm -rf / 2>/dev/null`
!!!
We cannot really use cat /etc/passwd here because system command by default does NOT return anything. It just executes whatever is given on the system.
