For microsoft office files (ppt, doc, xls ..) we can extract metadata by opening them in Microsoft Powerpoint, Word, Excel and then going to **File => Info** part. We can then see who created that file at which date, when it is modified by whom etc.

Method:
1. Pick your target website
2. Run site:target filetype:pdf `bgasecurity.com filetype:pdf OR filetype:docx`
3. Download all files
4. Extract metadata from all files
5. See authors, system names, creation dates, etc ..
