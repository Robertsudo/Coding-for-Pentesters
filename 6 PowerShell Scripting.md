Unlike bash, PowerShell is extremely restrictive. Security measures are everywhere.

## four types of execution policies
1. Restricred => (by defalt) cannot run any powershell script at all.
2. Unrestricted => what we want
3. Allsigned => we can only run scripts that have been signed by a trusted publisher.
4. Remotesigned => can run local scripts but needs signing for remote downloaded scripts

HKEY = Handle to Registry Key
## five major sections
```powershell
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE =======> accessible as normal user
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG
HKEY_CURRENT_USER =====> accessible as normal user
HKEY_USERS
HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
```
