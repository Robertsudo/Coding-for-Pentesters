Goals
1. Web servie status utility => Using if/else, HTTP and SYS modules
2. Subnet calculator => Using lists
3. Password cracker => Using dictionaries (key/value pairs
4. ***Socket programming***
5. Scapy => can manipulate data at **every layer** (all 7 of them) of the OSI stack

`sys.argv[0]` => name of the python script I am running in (myscript.py)
`sys.argv[1]` => first argument (like IP addr, port .. )

`root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash`
```
username: root
password: x (shadowed)
UID = 0
GID = 0
full name: root
home directory: /root
shell directory: /bin/bash
```
`batunix:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/batunix:/bin/bash`
**,,,** part denotes full name, email, telephone number etc. (empty here)
# If statements
```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
myuid = os.getuid()
if myuid == 0:
	print("You are ROOT!")
elif myuid < 500:
	print("You are a system account")
else:
	print("You are just a regular user.")
```
Note that regular linux accounts start with UID at least or equal to 500. Root UID is always 0.

# Network (Socket) Programming; AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM
```
AF = ADDRESS FAMILY
AF_INET => IPv4 socket
AF_INET6 => IPv6 socket
AF_UNIX => local socket
AF_RAW => raw socket

SOCK_STREAM => TCP-style sockets
SOCK_DGRAM => UDP-style sockets
SOCK_RAW => raw sockets
```
# Stealing (exfiltrating) data from corporate environment via ICMP pings (by using echo-reply packets in **Scapy**)
***homework*** look for Tasks
use
`from scapy.all import *`
DO NOT use:
`import scapy.all`
Why ? 
because if we import like the latter one then every time we want to use a method from scapy  we have to write full name (scapy.all.method)
but by importing * we can use just method names.

***example:***
if you use `import sys` ==========> then have to use `sys.exit()`
whereas if you use `from sys import *` ======> you can just use `exit()` without writing sys.
