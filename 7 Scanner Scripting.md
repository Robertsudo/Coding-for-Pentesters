Netcat, nmap and nessus / openVAS

- Netcat is installed by default on most windows and linux boxes.

- Nmap can be customized using NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts (written in Lua scripting language)

- Nessus is the ancestor of OpenVAS. Nessus then turned into a closed source tool while OpenVAS remained as open source. Since they are of common origin, they both use Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) for expansion plug-ins.

# Netcat (nc)
Similar tools:
- Socat
- Cryptcat => supports Twofish encryption
- Ncat => on windows boxes
- Pwncat

We can port-scan, build a basic WEB server, transfer files using netcat.
```bash
nc -lvnp 8080 # listen on port 8080, verbose, no DNS resolution, receiver
nc -v 10.0.1.1 8080 < mysecretfile.txt # sender
```

# Nmap (Network mapper)
```bash
/usr/share/nmap => nmap-service-probes  nmap-services
```
# Nessus (closed source by Tenable) and OpenVAS (open source)
Example NASL scripting code to grab banner from port 21 FTP:
(code similar to Perl, notice semicolon ; at the end of every statement)
```perl
socket = open_sock_tcp(21);
if (!socket) exit(0); # if cannot open a socket then exit
banner = recv_line(socket:socket, length:4096);
display(banner);
```
